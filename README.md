## Hi there, I'm Alexandros, but you can call me Alex

### I'm a developer who loves making things work better—usually with C++, C, Rust and a dash of Python and Lua.

- 🚀 Currently hacking on OpenTwin and building terminal tools (runa).  
- 🧰 Languages I enjoy: C++, C, Rust; - also enjoy Lua and Python, and looking forward on learning Go.  
- 🖥️ I like working on real-world problems with an emphasis on simulations and systems programming, especially tools and cross-platform projects.  
- ☕ Never too far from a coffee mug.  
- 🎓 You'll often find me balancing code, coffee, and coursework.
