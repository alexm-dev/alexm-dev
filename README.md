I'm a developer passionate about making things work better—usually with **C++**, **C**, **Rust**, and a dash of **Python** and **Lua**.

### 🚀 Currently Working On

### 🧰 Languages & Tools
- **Primary:** C, C++, Rust  
- **Also Enjoy:** Lua, Python  
- **Learning Next:** Go  

### 🖥️ Interests
- Real-world problem solving with an emphasis on **simulations** and **systems programming**  
- Building **tools** and **cross-platform projects**

### ☕ Fun Fact
- I live in my terminal—and occasionally visit the GUI.  
- Why click buttons when you can type them?  
- Often balancing code, coffee, and coursework.
